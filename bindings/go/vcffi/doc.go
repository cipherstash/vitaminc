// Package vcffi is the shared FFI transport codec of the vitaminc Go
// bindings: the wire encoding that carries a value tree into a wasm guest
// and a ciphertext tree back out, together with the Encryptable/Encoder
// extension point for types that control their own encoding.
//
// It exists as its own module so every binding that owns a wasm boundary
// speaks the same bytes from one implementation — vcencrypt (the
// vitaminc-encrypt reference binding) and the stack-encrypt Go SDK are the
// intended consumers. Forking the codec per binding is exactly the failure
// mode this module prevents: one codec, one hostile-input test suite, one
// fuzz corpus.
//
// # Transport, not storage
//
// These bytes are an FFI detail with no compatibility commitment. The only
// frozen format is the sealed leaf inside the AEAD envelope (see
// vcvalue.Sealed and the Rust crate vitaminc-aead-value). Nothing this
// package encodes should ever be persisted; durable cross-language interop
// is a schema-aware layer's job.
//
// # Values and ciphertexts
//
// [Marshal] and [Unmarshal] carry the plaintext value model (Go natives,
// vcvalue.Object for maps, vcvalue.Plain for passthrough): Marshal walks
// ordinary Go values with encoding/json-style rules, consulting
// [Encryptable] first so a user type can drive the [Encoder] channels
// itself.
//
// [MarshalCipherText] and [UnmarshalCipherText] carry the ciphertext tree.
// Its structural nodes ([]any, map[string]any, vcvalue.Plain) are common to
// every binding, but the sealed-leaf marker types are deliberately not: each
// binding supplies a [LeafSet] mapping its own leaf types onto the framing,
// so a leaf sealed by one cipher is a distinct Go type from a leaf sealed by
// another and can never scan or marshal where the other belongs.
// [VCValueLeaves] is the set for the vcvalue model types.
//
// # Hostile input
//
// The decoders treat their input as untrusted: recursion depth, length
// prefixes and item counts are bounded, strings are UTF-8 validated,
// duplicate map keys are rejected, and every malformed shape fails with
// [ErrMalformed] rather than panicking or over-allocating. The fuzz targets
// in this package pin that contract.
