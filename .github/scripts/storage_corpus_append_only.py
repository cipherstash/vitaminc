"""Check that the storage profile's golden corpus only grows.

`packages/aead-frame/testdata/storage-v1.json` pins the bytes of version 1
of the storage profile (packages/aead-frame/STORAGE.md). Customers keep
blobs in that format, so a row the corpus already had is a promise: its
bytes read as its value, or are refused as its class, in every later
release. The Rust test holds the code to the corpus; this check holds the
corpus to itself. Every row at the merge base must still be there, under
the same name and unchanged, as must the header and version. Rows and
sections may be added.

Run `mise run storage:corpus:check -- --base origin/main` to check this
branch against main.
